        "In this project, I am trying to find out what are the most common reactions of the Dominican users of IG when prompted crime news. I am analyzing the case of Paula Santana, who was the victim of two co-workers (killed in her job); one of them she had reported for harassment, but Human Resources didn't take it seriously. These kind of news always cause a strong reaction from the public, so I think it should be interesting to analyze these comments and try to establish the public's position on how to adress these issues, how it affects security concerns, especially for women, and a reflection on the victim's validation: people care more about victim's that are young, students, beautiful, etc. rather than the nature of the crime.\n",
        "\n",
        "For emotion detection, I use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on TF-IDF vectors of comment text and for topic modeling, I use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). I also use a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to classify comments into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral or just how strong the negative reactions were.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main challenges was the data collection, because web scraping for IG web seems to be very difficult, hence, many researchers prefer to extract comments from Twitter. I decided to use APIFY's instagram scraper for small news and excel cleaning for the mainstream media news. Also, the scope of my research questions might not be answered by the applied methods."

        "The International Encyclopedia of Education (2023) defines **discourse analysis** as \"*the epistemological framework for investigating discourse which allows it to approach the variety of discursive genres and to describe the complexity of the discourse and of the interaction*\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Not from me: *Discourse analysis is a field of research composed of multiple heterogeneous, largely qualitative, approaches to the study of relationships between language-in-use and the social world. Researchers in the field typically view language as a form of social practice that influences the social world, and vice versa. Many contemporary varieties of discourse analysis have, explicitly or implicitly, been influenced by Michel Foucault's theories related to power, knowledge, and discourse*.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, discourse analysis has been traditionally a qualitative research approach, that aims to extract social meaning from the study of the use of the language. According to Melissa N.P. Johnson, Ethan McLean (2020)   researchers in the field typically view language as a form of social practice that influences the social world, and vice versa.\n",

        "is of particular interests for many core language processing tasks like language modeling (Ji et al., 2016) and applications such as machine translation and its evaluation (Sennrich, 2018; Laubli et al., 2018; Joty et al., 2017), text categorization (Ji and Smith, 2017), and sentiment analysis (Nejat et al., 2017). With the advent of Internet technologies, new forms of discourse are emerging (e.g., emails and discussion forums) with novel set of challenges for the computational models.\n",
